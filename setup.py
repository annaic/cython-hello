"""This Python code is part of setup configuration for a Python application. It signifies that the application is using 
Cython, a programming language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as easy as Python itself. 
Cython enables the inclusion of both Python-like syntax and native C data types.

The setup function is used to package Python modules, and ext_modules defines additional external modules that are 
necessary for the package.
In the provided code, cythonize is a utility that compiles Cython source files (.pyx) into C or C++ files, which are 
then compiled into Python extension modules that can be imported into Python code.

The string "cyfib.pyx" is the name of a Cython source file that the function will compile.

The argument compiler_directives is a dictionary that contains directives for the Cython compiler. 
{"language_level": "3"} sets the language level to Python 3 syntax.

Here is a detailed explanation:
setup: This a function from setuptools module, which is a library in Python that is used to package Python code. 
It includes all the metadata about the package, like what code belongs to it and the dependencies it uses.

ext_modules: This argument to setup function defines the list of all the extensions modules to build from Cython/C/C++ 
files.

cythonize: This is one function that compiles Python-like (Cython) source code to C/C++ source code 
(which then gets compiled to a Python extension by a C compiler).

"cyfib.pyx": This is the path of the Cython file that needs to be compiled to a Python extension, which you can 
be used just like any other Python module.
compiler_directives: This is a dictionary that controls various parts of Cython compilation. 
{"language_level": "3"} means that the Cython file should be interpreted as Python 3 syntax. 
This is required because Cython is also compatible with Python 2, and there are some syntax differences between 
Python 2 and Python 3."""
